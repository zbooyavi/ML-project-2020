# Telco Customer Churn Prediction-2020
Context:

In this project we are going to predict the behavior of telecom customers who are more likely to leave the platform in order to help retain customers.

Content:

Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes such as:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
Projected ML techniques:

We are going to use different models such as logistic regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN, etc., to predict customer churn and then compare the results of each of the models.
